I use the new Jasper Artificial Intelligence (AI) Art service to create the pictures in this blog post.

[Jasper AI Art](https://jasper.ai/art) (non-affiliate link), for example, creates the following picture of the **World's Largest Turnip**.

Jasper generates a **before and after** picture of a fat cat.

The AI service also produces a picture of ET in a phone booth.

This month, I demonstrate the service and discuss the history of the service, which begins with the **OpenAI foundation**.

## OpenAI
[Elon Musk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk) (Tesla), [Sam Altman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman) (Y Combinator), [Greg Brockman](https://gregbrockman.com/) (Stripe) and [Ilya Sutskever](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~ilya/) (Google) pledged over $1B to found [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) in December, 2015.  

OpenAI funds the development of **friendly** Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) that drives the health, happiness and improvement of our human race.

OpenAI develops interesting Generative models, including one for text ([GPT-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3)) and one for images ([DALLE-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DALL-E)).  

The DALLE-2 model inputs descriptive [natural language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language) text, renders an image of the description and then outputs that image to the screen.

OpenAI invites the [public to use DALLE-2](https://labs.openai.com/auth/signup), which yields sometimes [hilarious results](https://twitter.com/weirddalle).

You can try the API for free via [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/spaces/dalle-mini/dalle-mini), or [Crayon](https://www.craiyon.com/), but (in July 2022) these services take minutes to produce images.  Jasper AI Art reduces the **wall clock** time down to seconds.

## Jasper AI Art
[Dave Rogenmoser](https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/ai-content-platform-jasper-raises-125m-at-a-1-7b-valuation/), J.P. Morgan and Chris Hull formed Jasper AI in early 2021. Since then, Jasper AI provides the GPT-3 model for [copywriting and Search Engine Optimization (SEO)]({filename}/jasper-ai.md) use cases.

This month, Jasper opens their Jasper Art service to their customers.

Jasper Art provides an easy-to-use interface to DALLE-2, and accelerates the image generation process to seconds.

I use the Jasper Art service to create the following pictures.

Fight Club Simpsons.

## Sign Up
Jasper sent me an invitation to try their new **Art** service.  They boast that **artificial intelligence now can create any image or art you can imagine in seconds**.

![Email]({static}/images/Jasper_Art/09_Jasper_Email.png)

Clicking through the links takes me to a payment page.  Unlimited access to the Art service costs $20/month.

![Sign Up]({static}/images/Jasper_Art/10_Sign_Up.png)

## The User Interface
Jasper provides a User Interface (UI) to generate art.  You enter a text description and then use the drop down selector boxes to set the **Style, Medium, Artist** and **Mood**.

![Blank Jasper Art UI]({static}/images/Jasper_Art/11_Jasper_Ui.png)

I decide to enter the following input:

  -  Text Description
    -  John Travolta from Saturday Night Fever in a Magnavox Odyssey 2 game
  -  Style
    -  Pixel art
  -  Medium
    -  None Specified
  -  Artist
    -  Andy Warhol
  -  Mood
    -  Frightening

![Travolta Input]({static}/images/Jasper_Art/12_Travolta_Text.png)

Within seconds, Jasper Renders the following four images.

![John Travolta from Saturday Night Fever in a Magnavox Odyssey 2 game]({static}/images/Jasper_Art/13_Magnovox_Travolta.png)

I like this one the best, although it looks more like a Commodore 64 game.

![Andy Warhol Travolta]({static}/images/Jasper_Art/14_Travolta_Warhol.png)

I change the Style to **3d Render** and Mood to **Aggressive**.  I also add **The Situation** from **Jersey Shore**.

  - Text Description
    - John Travolta from Saturday Night Fever hanging out with the Situation from Jersey Shore
  - Style
    - 3d Render
  - Medium
    - None Specified
  - Artist
    - None Specified
  - Mood
    - Aggressive

![Four pics of John Travolta from Saturday Night Fever hanging out with the Situation from Jersey Shore]({static}/images/Jasper_Art/15_Travolta_Render.png)

The result looks straight from a PlayStation Two game.

![Travolta and Sitch]({static}/images/Jasper_Art/16_Travolta_Situation.png)

Changing the style back to **Pixel Art** produces new art.

![Travolta and Sitch Pixels]({static}/images/Jasper_Art/17_Travolta_Pixel.png)

Jasper nailed the **Low Cut Vee** shirt!

![PlayStation presents the Jersey Shore]({static}/images/Jasper_Art/18_The_Situation.png)

I remember a joke about a Vulture with Carry On (Carrion) and input it into Jasper.

  - Text Description
    - Vulture with Carrion in Airplane cabin
  - Style
    - Cartoon
  - Medium
    - Spray Paint
  - Artist
    - Dr. Suess
  - Mood
    - Happy

![Dr. Suess Vulture Carrion Carry On]({static}/images/Jasper_Art/19_Vulture_Cartoon.png)

I love the trippy Dr. Suess result, although I don't see a Vulture nor Carrion.

![Dr. Suess Trippy]({static}/images/Jasper_Art/20_Dr_Suess.png)

I re-run with the same inputs.

![Attempt Two]({static}/images/Jasper_Art/21_Vulture_Spray.png)

While Jasper missed the boat, I do like the look of this picture.  It reminds me of a Sci Fi pulp magazine from the early 1930's.

![Vulture, Painting]({static}/images/Jasper_Art/22_Vulture_Spraypaint.png)

I run the input once more and add **Art Deco** to the description.

![Art Deco Vulture]({static}/images/Jasper_Art/23_Vulture_Deco.png)

We get a vulture in the airplane cabin, but no Carrion.

![Sans Carry On]({static}/images/Jasper_Art/24_Vulture_Artdeco.png)

## A Toddler gets Silly
At this point my toddler walks over and asks me to make **planet earth made out of poop emoji**.

![planet earth made out of poop emoji]({static}/images/Jasper_Art/25_Poop_Ui.png)

He laughed at **Poop World**.

![planet earth made out of poop emoji - poop world]({static}/images/Jasper_Art/26_Poop_World.png)

Next up - **Poopy pants** (I did mention I have a toddler).

![Jasper creates poopy pants]({static}/images/Jasper_Art/27_Poopy_Pants.png)

This image looks like a Fark **Photoshop Friday** from 2003.

![Poopy Pants DALLE-2]({static}/images/Jasper_Art/28_Poop_Pants.png)

He then requests more silly pictures. 

First up, Boxing a Cow.

Pumpkin Skeleton.

## I get Silly
The silliness inspires me.  I think of some more ideas.

Propaganda  Wario.

Nysnc + Nirvana.  Nirvanasync perhaps?

Selfie at the Smelter factory.

![Selfie at the Smelter factory.]({static}/images/Jasper_Art/41_Smelter_Selfie.png)

Finally, I just type **Ai Yiii Yiii Yiii** into the box.

![Ai Yiii Yiii Yiii]({static}/images/Jasper_Art/42_Ayiii_Yiiyiii.png)

## Conclusion
I will use the Jasper Art Service to illustrate future blog posts.  I have writeups on Gerard Manley Hopkins and Yukio Mishima in the works that need interesting pictures.

I recommend the service for any small (or big) business that needs to create compelling pictures beyond stock art.  The services provide an inexpensive and timely alternative to hiring graphic artists.
