Rarible enables artists to mint, sell and trade one-of-a-kind digital collectibles in the form of Non Fungible Tokens (NFT).  The Ethereum blockchain records the provenance of each NFT in a secure, distributed ledger that will last until the end of human civilization.  

You don't need to be a Blockchain wiz to mint NFT, you only need some Ethereum and a Web Browser.  In this blog post, I will demonstrate how to mint your very own NFT and sell them in the Rarible marketplace.  I will also show you how to register with the Rarible Royalty incentive, which pays each Artist a commission on all future sales of their NFT.

## Background
The scarcity, novelty and decentralized nature of Bitcoin and Ethereum attracts manic investors willing to pay top dollar for these speculative assets.  NFTs take the scarcity and novelty of these traditional cryptos to the next level.  Each NFT provides a unique token (or collection of tokens) that represents a piece of digital art.

The NFT landscape witnessed asymptotic growth in the past few months, with plenty of ridiculous sales.  A certain Big Data Architect, for example, paid three (3) Ethereum for a [Taco Gif](https://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:236715:0x99f93b966021d6c6883b84e4b184957f49af8b32).

That same highly respected thought leader also paid two (2) Ethereum for a [Toilet Paper Gif](https://rarible.com/token/0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5:489778:0x99f93b966021d6c6883b84e4b184957f49af8b32).

At least all proceeds went to Charity!

## Intro
Today I will demonstrate how to mint and sell a digital collectible on the [Rarible](https://rarible.com/) NFT marketplace.  I split this HOWTO into two parts.

- Part 1: [Create an Account on Rarible]({filename}/create-nft-with-rarible-part-1.md)
- Part 2: Create an NFT token

[Last Month]({filename}/create-nft-with-rarible-part-1.md) I demonstrated HOWTO create an account on Rarible.  If you have not logged into Rarible yet, open that link in a new tab and follow the instructions.

This blog post describes how create and sell an NFT token on Rarible.  In order to proceed with the instructions, you must have an account with Rarible.  [Click Here]({filename}/create-nft-with-rarible-part-1.md) to find instructions on how to create an account on Rarible.

## Create A Single Item
In this section, we will create a single item, and not place it for sale.

Click **create** in the upper right corner, right next to your Avatar picture.

![Click Create]({static}/images/Create_Nft_With_Rarible_Part_2/30_Click_Create.png)

On the **Create Collectible** screen, you can choose to mint a **Single** collectible or **Multiple**.  Select **Single**, which mints a one-of-a-kind NFT.

![Click Single]({static}/images/Create_Nft_With_Rarible_Part_2/31_Click_Single.png)

You can mint a video, song, static picture or animated Gif.  Under **Upload File** select **Choose File** and then from the selection box choose your file.  I upload a file of some Isometric Pixel Art that I created in MS Paint way back in 2005.  If you notice, I drew a CRT TV, with built in VCR, which should indicate the age of the artwork.

![Choose File]({static}/images/Create_Nft_With_Rarible_Part_2/32_Choose_File.png)

I want to keep my first ever NFT, so I de-select the toggle button an turn off the ability to sell the item.

![Select Nfs]({static}/images/Create_Nft_With_Rarible_Part_2/33_Select_Nfs.png)

Under **Edit Details** you will add Metadata.  First, enter an interesting **Name**.  I named my collectible **Isometric Pixel Art - Media Console.**  Add an optional **Description** and try to sell the work.  Why would someone buy it?  Put an interesting narrative here.

![Edit Details]({static}/images/Create_Nft_With_Rarible_Part_2/34_Edit_Details.png)

Once a collector buys your **NFT**, she can sell it.  When she sells the NFT, you have the ability to receive a portion of **Royalties**.  Every time the NFT trades hands, you will receive a **Royalty**.  What commission do you want for future sales?  I put **10%**.

**Properties** records the **tags** associated with the art.  You enter **Key Value Pairs** into this section, for example, **YEAR: 2005, MEDIUM: MS PAINT**.  You could enter your name, or location.  Put any properties you find interesting.

After you fill out the form, click **Create Item**.

![Click Create]({static}/images/Create_Nft_With_Rarible_Part_2/35_Click_Create.png)

Rarible then connects to your Ethereum wallet to confirm your identity and funds.  The Mint process requires Ethereum ***gas***.  Expect to pay around seventy dollars USD ($70) to drive the minting.  You can try at different times of day to find a lower price.  The market drives the price.  Pay the gas and click **Confirm**.

![Confirm Fees]({static}/images/Create_Nft_With_Rarible_Part_2/36_Confirm_Fees.png)

Rarible returns you to your home screen.  If you see your home screen, then Rarible began the mint process.

![Success Screen]({static}/images/Create_Nft_With_Rarible_Part_2/37_Success_Screen.png)

After a few minutes, Rarible completes the creation of your NFT.  Once completed, your NFT appears under your **Collectibles** tab.

![All Done]({static}/images/Create_Nft_With_Rarible_Part_2/38_All_Done.png)

Click your collectible and Rarible lists the NFT Metadata.  You can select four tabs: **Info**, **Owners**, **History**, **Details** and **Bids**.

![Nft Details]({static}/images/Create_Nft_With_Rarible_Part_2/39_Nft_Details.png)

- **Info** records the current owner, creator, royalty and collection (the NFT standard used to mint the NFT)
- **Owners** records the current owners of the NFT.  Some artists release multiple copies of the same collectible.  This tab will show all of the collectors that own a copy
- **History** records all events associated with the NFT.  This includes owners that put the item up for Sale, Bids made by collectors, purchase price, minting and transfers
- **Bids** includes a subset of the **History** tab, and only presents offers made and canceled by prospective buyers

## Create and Sell Multiple Copies of the Same Item
In this section, we will create multiple copies of a collectible, and place them all on sale.

Once more, click **create** in the upper right corner of the Rarible screen.

![Click Create]({static}/images/Create_Nft_With_Rarible_Part_2/30_Click_Create.png)

Select **Multiple**.

![Select Multiple]({static}/images/Create_Nft_With_Rarible_Part_2/40_Select_Multiple.png)

Under **Upload File** select **Choose File** and select your artwork.  I selected an **Isometric Pixel Art** representation of the **Eames Lounge Chair and Ottoman**.

If you want to sell the item, select **Put on Sale**.

If you select **Instance Sale Price**, you will have the option to set a **Buy It Now** price.  I selected this option and set the price to **0.1 ETH** which roughly equals $200 USD.

![For Sale]({static}/images/Create_Nft_With_Rarible_Part_2/41_For_Sale.png)

Under **Collection**, select **Rarible**.  This tells **Rarible** to use the **ERC1155** protocol to mint the NFT.  If you select this option, you can buy and sell the NFT on **Rarible** and other marketplaces.  **OpenSea** supports this protocol.

Add a Royalty.  Every time your NFT trades hands you will make a commission.

Under **Number of Copies** click the amount of tokens you wish to mint.  You can mint thousands or a handful.  I entered five (5).

![Enter Qty]({static}/images/Create_Nft_With_Rarible_Part_2/43_Enter_Qty.png)

Scroll down and add tags.  I added the **Dimensions: 644 x 493 Pixels** key/ value pair.  Get creative.  You can add any Key/ Value pair you wish.

![Add Tags]({static}/images/Create_Nft_With_Rarible_Part_2/42_Add_Tags.png)

Select **Create Item** and then **Confirm** the Gas fee for the approval process.

![Confirm Fee]({static}/images/Create_Nft_With_Rarible_Part_2/44_Confirm_Fee.png)

You now need to pay **gas** to mint the item.  I somehow only needed to pay $40 USD.  You should expect to pay around $70.  Click **Confirm**.

![Upload Fee]({static}/images/Create_Nft_With_Rarible_Part_2/46_Upload_Fee.png)

Now you sign the sell order.  If someone agrees to pay your ask price, Rarible will sell them the token.  Click **Sign**.

![Sign Sell]({static}/images/Create_Nft_With_Rarible_Part_2/47_Sign_Sell.png)

After a few minutes, Rarible finishes creating your token, and the new token appears in your **For Sale** tab.

![New Token]({static}/images/Create_Nft_With_Rarible_Part_2/48_New_Token.png)

If you click the item, Rarible lists the details of the item.  You have the ability to cancel the sale if you do not want to let go of the item.

![Sale Page]({static}/images/Create_Nft_With_Rarible_Part_2/49_Sale_Page.png)

## Conclusion
Rarible provides an exciting and fun way to create valuable digital collectibles.
