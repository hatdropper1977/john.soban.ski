[Brave Software](https://brave.com) developed a privacy-focused browser, that (unlike competitors) blocks all online advertisements and web trackers by default.

**Brave Rewards** pays out content providers crypto based on views.

In order to get paid, you must get **Brave Creator Verified**.  A **blue check** indicates if Brave granted a given website **Brave Verified Creator** status.

In the screen grab below, you will see that [this site](https://john.soban.ski) received the **Brave Verified Creator** blue check.

This blog post walks us through the process of receiving that blue check.

# Install the Brave Browser
In order to reap the benefits of **Brave**, we must first install the software.

Open the [Brave Download Page](https://brave.com/download) in a new tab and click the **Download** button.

![Download Brave]({filename}/images/Brave_Verified_Creator/01_Download_Brave.png)

After the download completes, **Open** the installer to start installation.

![Open the Installer]({filename}/images/Brave_Verified_Creator/02_Open_Installer.png)

Click **Run**.

![Run the Installer]({filename}/images/Brave_Verified_Creator/03_Run_Installer.png)

The Installer provides status through the installation.

It first phones home to the Brave download repository.

The Installer then downloads the binary.

![The Installer Downloads]({filename}/images/Brave_Verified_Creator/05_Install_Download.png)

It checks your Operating System.

![Wait for the Installer]({filename}/images/Brave_Verified_Creator/06_Install_Wait.png)

The Installer then begins installation.

![Installation Commences]({filename}/images/Brave_Verified_Creator/07_Install_Execute.png)

After the Installer completes, it launches the **Brave Browser**.

# Configure the Browser
Brave allows you to import bookmarks, apps and history from another browser.  Select **Chrome Person 1** if you previously used Chrome.

![Import Chrome Bookmarks, Apps and History]({filename}/images/Brave_Verified_Creator/09_Import_Chrome.png)

Brave downloads your Chrome plugins.  You will see a series of completed Downloads (one for each plugin) with filenames that include random characters.  

![Import all your Chrome Plugins]({filename}/images/Brave_Verified_Creator/10_Plugin_Download.png)

Select [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) for your default search engine.  DuckDuckGo provides a private, secure Internet search service, free from trackers and spyware.

# Register and Connect Crypto Wallet
In addition to security and privacy, the Brave browser pays you to surf the Internet.

In order to get rewards, you must link a Crypto wallet to your browser.  Click **Start Using Rewards** to begin.  

![Click Start Rewards]({filename}/images/Brave_Verified_Creator/12_Start_Rewards.png)

Brave provides a wizard that explains how to earn rewards.  Either click through the tour or click **Skip.**

At present time, **Brave** provides the option to select either the [Uphold](https://uphold.com) or [Gemini](https://www.gemini.com) Crypto wallet.

In this blog post, I use **Uphold**, which also allows easy connection the **Brave** smart phone App. 

![Select Uphold for Brave Wallet]({filename}/images/Brave_Verified_Creator/16_Click_Uphold.png)

Click **Authorize**.

![Click Authorize]({filename}/images/Brave_Verified_Creator/17_Click_Authorize.png)

Click the green text that reads **Sign up now** and then fill out the web form.

![Sign Up]({filename}/images/Brave_Verified_Creator/18_Sign_Up.png)

Brave redirects to an information screen.

At this point, you will need to check the email account of the address you entered into the web form.

![Check you Email]({filename}/images/Brave_Verified_Creator/19_Will_Redirect.png)

Find the **Uphold** email in your email client, open the email and then click **Verify**.

![Uphold Verification]({filename}/images/Brave_Verified_Creator/20_Verify_Uphold.png)

**Uphold** provides another wizard to create the crypto wallet.

Fill out the required information and complete the wizard.

![A Wizard to Sign Up for Uphold]({filename}/images/Brave_Verified_Creator/21_Verify_Wizard.png)

**Uphold** uses [Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) to protect your registration.

Provide a cell phone number in order to receive a secret hash that you must enter to continue.

![Verify your phone number]({filename}/images/Brave_Verified_Creator/22_Verify_Phone.png)

After you enter the MFA token, enter your home address.

Once Uphold returns the **Dashboard** screen, click **Verify your identity**.

![Click Verify ID]({filename}/images/Brave_Verified_Creator/26_Click_Verifyid.png)

The web page provides a [QR code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code).  Take a picture of the code with your cell phone camera and then navigate to the displayed web page on your cell phone.

![Scan the QR Code]({filename}/images/Brave_Verified_Creator/27_Scan_Qr.png)

Switch over to your smartphone and follow the instructions.

You will need to snap pictures of your driver's license or passport.

Close the message and select the **Enable Two Factor Authentication** button.  Uphold will present a QR code.  Use you smartphone to scan this code with the MFA app of your choice.  I use [Authy](https://authy.com).
