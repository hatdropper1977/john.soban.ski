Why do we need yet another personality test?  Because, without "big data" technologies online "personality tests" suffer these problems:

  -   With most tests, we quickly see a pattern to the answers, and can easily steer the test to the outcome we want
    -   Do we really learn anything when we "cheat" this way?  (No)
  -   Test writers like to invent their own cryptic definitions for commonly understood words
    -   See various definitions for Extrovert, Intuition, Conscientious,etc.
  -   The math to calculate the results must be kept simple (weighted sums), to reduce server overhead
  -   To keep in line with the simple math, a lot of these tests force an un-natural, robotic answer format
    -   Do I strongly or highly agree with the statement they just presented to me?

Freshlex, LLC presents a "big data" personality test, for charity.  Our test differs from traditional tests:

  -   Ours is fun!  A combination of serious, thought provoking, and silly questions
  -   Random, arbitrary questions
    -   We won't see a pattern until enough people take the test and we crunch the numbers
  -   Simple "yes" or "no" answers... no "somewhat/ slightly/ strongly agree" garbage
  -   Since we do the "heavy lifting" on the back end, we can keep it fun and simple for the user
  -   Ours goes to charity
    -   We will be open about the expenses involved in this voyage.  If by some miracle we figure out how to make money off this, we'll [donate it to charity](http://rmhcbaltimore.org/).
